# Demographic modelling of grey reef sharks (*Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos*)
This repository contains the codes necessary to replicate the *moments* analyses from the following paper: 

Cameron Walsh, Paolo Momigliano, Germain Boussarie, William Robbins, Lucas Bonnin, Cecile Fauvelot, Jeremy Kiszka, David Mouillot, Laurent Vigliola, and St√©phanie Manel (2022). Genomic insights into the historical and contemporary demographics of the grey reef shark. *Heredity* XXX:XXX-XXX DOI: XXX 

The pipeline used for demographic analyses is built based on the pipelines for dadi developed by Tine et al (2014) and Portik et al (2017),  modified to work on moments by Momigliano et al (2021),  then by Alan le Moan (Le Moan et al 2021), and again modified by Paolo Momigliano for this manuscript.
